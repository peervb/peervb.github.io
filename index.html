        [Our world] "never has enough conscience, nor enough tolerance,
        idealism, justice, compassion, wisdom, humility, self-sacrifice for the
        greater good, integrity, courtesy, poetry, laughter, and generosity of
        substance and spirit. It is these elements that I urge you to carry into
        your careers, and remember that the great game of life is not about
        money; it is about doing your best to build the world anew."
